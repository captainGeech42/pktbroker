[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/captainGeech42/pktbroker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/captainGeech42/pktbroker)

A minimal packet broker for lab purposes

Planned Features:
* Packet deduplication
* Packet aggregation

Please note that the performance of this tool is almost definitely not suitable for any type of production environment. If you need packet agg/dedup at scale, check out the lovely folks at [APCON](https://www.apcon.com/), or Gigamon if you have a million dollars.
